# Hello there! 👋 I'm Kim Syversen

## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

My name is Kim Syversen, and I'm a security professional with a diverse background in IT operations, security, and software development. With 10+ years of experience, my work within security has primarily focused on security operations, penetration testing, and cloud security.

🔒 As a security professional, I'm passionate about ensuring that systems and data are secure from external and internal threats. Recently, I've been interested in the integration of security in the development process, particularly in the area of DevSecOps. I believe that DevSecOps practices, combined with cloud security, can lead to more secure and reliable systems.

👨‍💻 Along with my interest in DevSecOps and cloud security, I also have a keen interest in software architecture. I believe that good architecture plays a significant role in building secure and scalable systems.

🎓 I hold numerous certifications and have extensive experience working with a variety of security tools and technologies. I'm always open to learning about new tools and techniques to improve my work.
